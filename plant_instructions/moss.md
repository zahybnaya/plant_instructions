Care Instructions for Plant 'Moss' (Commonly Known as 'Tropic Moss')

Common and Scientific Name(s):
- Pteris vittata

Watering Requirements:
Frequency: Daily in the hottest part of the day, 3 to 4 hours.
Amount: Water sparingly when plant is dormant for best results.
Light Needs: Full sun (6-8 hours/day) for optimal growth and blooming.
Soil Preference: Well-drained soil with good aeration; avoid clay or heavy soils.
Temperature Requirements: Temperatures should range between 60°F to 75°F (15°C to 24°C).
Humidity: Humid conditions will enhance the growth of plants, but avoid soggy soil as this can cause root rot.

Soil Preparation:
- Remove any dead or diseased leaves and debris from the base of the plant.
- Clean the soil with a hose to remove dirt, debris, and any excess nutrients.
- Fill the pot about 2 inches (5 cm) above the rim of the pot with compost or organic matter.
- Moisten the soil slightly before planting.

Propagation:
- Cuttings taken during late summer/early fall (mid October to mid January).
- Dig a hole that is twice the depth of the root ball, remove any roots, and fill with compost or potting soil.
- Gently loosen the soil around the new plant, then firm it down.

Care during Transplanting:
- Firm soil around the base of the new plant before transferring it to its permanent location.
- Do not overfill the pot, as this can lead to root rot.

Fertilization Schedule:
- Soil Test for PH and nutrient levels.
- Apply a balanced fertilizer after the soil has been tested.
- Do not apply fertilizer too frequently as this may overload the roots with nutrients.

Propagaion Methods:
- Hands-on propagation by cutting stems to desired length, then inserting into the pot of freshly mixed soil.
- Seedlings can be grown from cuttings taken during fall/winter or spring/summer if a new plant has not been available at time of cut.
- Cuttings will need a little extra watering compared to potted plants, but do not overwater or the roots will rot.

Common Problems and Solutions:
- Wilted leaves due to excessive humidity.
- Leaves turning yellow or brown.
- Pests like leafminers or caterpillars.
- Diseases can be treated with fungicides such as Benlate, Naled, and Triazine herbicides.
- Regular watering is essential to prevent root rot caused by too much moisture at the base of the plant.
- Be sure to clean the soil thoroughly after transplantation or propagation.
