Care Instructions for 'Sheang Jiang' (Pleaosus hirsutus)

Common and Scientific Name(s): Sheang Jiang, P. hirsutus

Watering Requirements (Frequency, Amount): Direct sunlight daily for 6-10 hours. Partial shade required during heatwave or for long periods of low light. Water when the soil is dry to the touch (not dried out), then leave in place for 24 hours before watering again.

Light Needs (Direct Sunlight, Plants Preference): Direct sunlight for best growth and flowering; partial shade is suitable in some climates. Suitable for growing in average temperatures ranging from 60°F to 85°F.

Soil Preference: Soils require a good amount of water to retain moisture, and should not be allowed to become dry. P. hirsutus prefers well-draining soil with low pH levels (7.2-7.8).

Temperature and Humidity Requirements: Propagation methods require optimal temperature and humidity, which can vary depending on the time of year. During the growing season, temperatures should be between 60°F to 85°F; during the cooler months (November-March), temperatures may vary slightly. Humidity levels are crucial for plant growth. Propagation methods require optimal humidity levels, which can vary depending on the time of year. During the growing season, humidity levels should be between 60% to 75%, while during the cooler months (November-March), humidity levels may vary slightly.

Fertilization Schedule: Fertilize in spring or summer as needed for optimal plant growth and flowering. Add liquid fertilizer directly into soil, avoiding potting mix.

Propagaion Methods: Propagation methods require optimal humidity levels. During the growing season, propagation may be carried out on a timer or by hand-picking plants from the garden. During the cooler months (November-March), propagation may be carried out using cuttings or by seed sowing.

Common Problems and Solutions: Common problems include overwatering, root rot, and pest infestations. Common solutions for overwatering include removing excess water from the soil, using a good quality plant food, and pruning off dead or damaged plants. For root rot, check the soil for any signs of pests, such as mites, and remove them with soapy water. For pest infestations, use organic pest control products, or plant in a different location if possible to avoid overcrowding.

Additional Information:

- 'Sheang Jiang' is a hardy perennial shrub that prefers partial shade. It may need some exposure to sunlight during the hottest part of the day, but should be able to tolerate extended periods of shade during hot summer months.

- Plants require good airflow and good drainage to thrive, as excessive humidity or moist soil can cause root rot.

- Propagation methods such as cuttings or seed sowing may be carried out in the spring or summer for optimal plant growth and flowering.

- Planting in a different location can help to avoid overcrowding, which can lead to root rot.
